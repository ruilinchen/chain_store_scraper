get branch locations for global chain store brands

Most of global chains have a store locator in their website. This locator usually allows for searching by zip codes. Therefore, I begin by compiling a list of zip codes for the destination of interest. Below, I will use Seattle, WA, USA as an example. 
- First collect zip codes from [WorldPostalCode](https://worldpostalcode.com/united-states/washington/seattle), which lists all the zip codes for cities all over the world. Zip code scraper can be found available here. All the collected zip codes are stored in a single file called "zip_codes_in_the_world.csv", which can be found in the data folder.
